### Hello! ðŸ˜Ž
I'm Cristian. 
 Currently I'm Software Quality Assurance Analyst on FIT (Flextronics Institute of Technology). I have been working in the software quality area for four years, having experience running different types of tests (exploratory, functional, regressive, API) manually and automatically (using Ruby, Java or Python).
